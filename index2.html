    <div class="container-fluid bg-primary text-white">THE ELEMENTAL KING 1
    
    Long ago, on the magnificent Elemental Planet—a world forged from raw creation—there lived the First People, ancient
    beings who embodied the pure forces of the universe: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Electricity, Ice, Crystal, Darkness,
    Light, Time, Space, Technology, Venom, Lava, Bone, Devil, Gravity, and more. To preserve balance and protect the cosmos,
    these beings made the ultimate sacrifice, binding their souls into the Elemental Stones and their bodies into the very
    cores of newborn worlds, creating weapons of unimaginable power. At the heart of this world ruled the High Ancient,
    father to three: Scarlet, the brilliant and beloved leader of the Elemental Rangers, and his younger sons, Jack and
    James. But Scarlet’s heart was twisted not by the Devil Stone, which she mastered, but by an even darker
    influence—Vaelkor, a venom-wielding ancient whose whispers of power led her to betray her people. A devastating
    rebellion followed, tearing the planet apart in a cataclysm of fire, storms, and shattering crystal. In a final
    desperate act, the High Ancient sealed Scarlet away on the prison world Troggovia, but knew the Elemental Planet could
    no longer survive. With the planet’s collapse inevitable, he cast the sacred Stones out across the stars, sending them
    to Earth to be hidden in temples, where they would sleep until needed again. With the last of his strength, the High
    Ancient placed Jack and James into escape vessels alongside the Stones, sending his sons to Earth to live as
    humans—unaware of the legacy, power, and destiny that awaited them, and of the storm that one day would rise again. On
    earth Jack and James become best friends since kindergarten until college.</div>
    <div class="container-fluid bg-secondary text-white">🛡️ Origin of the Armor Formation
    The Armor Formation, also known as the Elemental Overdrive Mode, was forged by the Ancients as a last-resort power in
    the time of total planetary war. Only the warriors who had balanced both heat and cold, pressure and flow, speed and
    control, were allowed to summon the True Morphin Core — a core that didn’t just grant armor, but turned the user into a
    walking elemental storm.
    
    Each of the seven elements contributes a vital layer of the armor:
    
    Fire – Raw aggression, heat projection.
    
    Water – Fluidity, cooling systems, energy circulation.
    
    Metal – Durability, weapon creation.
    
    Lava – Destructive melting force, explosive bursts.
    
    Speed – Velocity, movement control, kinetic energy build-up.
    
    Gravity – Weight manipulation, force fields, ground control.
    
    Air – Mobility, aerial maneuvering, oxygen management.
    
    👁️ Visual Appearance
    The Armor Formation is colossal in presence. Think of a hybrid between a knight, a volcanic machine, and a storm avatar.
    
    Helmet: Sleek with retractable winged fins. Glows with red (fire), silver (metal), and blue (water) veins.
    
    Chestplate: Forged from lava-forged metal cooled by water, pulsing like a reactor core.
    
    Arms & Gauntlets: One burns red-hot (Fire), the other glows cold blue (Water), both capable of morphing into weapons
    (Metal).
    
    Legs: Jet boots powered by Speed Stone, allowing bursts faster than sound. Wings of pressurized Air extend for aerial
    combat.
    
    Back Core: A spinning gravity turbine that anchors and balances all elements — allows levitation and anti-physics
    combat.
    
    Whole Armor: Constantly morphing with metal shifting between lava vents and water-cooling lines. Surrounded by a thin
    shell of wind and plasma.
    
    ⚔️ Signature Weapon: The Overdrive Saber
    A hybrid sword-whip-cannon forged from elemental alloys.
    
    Can transform:
    
    🔥 Blazing Blade Mode – Flame-coated for melee devastation.
    
    🌊 Hydro Wave Mode – Water-jet saber that slices with high-pressure bursts.
    
    ⚙️ Metal Lance Mode – Solid steel drill-blade for piercing anything.
    
    🌋 Lava Burst Mode – Molten core erupts in explosive strikes.
    
    💨 Speedstream Mode – Turns into a lightning-fast rapier with air slashes.
    
    🌌 Gravity Break Mode – Summons planetary pressure with each swing.
    
    💥 Core Powers and Abilities
    🔥 Fire (Inferno System)
    Shoots flame jets from hands and feet.
    
    Can overheat parts of the armor for enhanced flame strikes.
    
    Summons a firestorm shield.
    
    🌊 Water (Aqua Core Drive)
    Cools down overheating.
    
    Can launch tidal blasts, freeze opponents, or heal minor injuries with vaporized mist.
    
    Controls battlefield moisture and weather.
    
    ⚙️ Metal (Morphin Forge)
    Can morph hands into blades, cannons, or shields.
    
    Absorbs metal from the environment to repair armor.
    
    Magnetic control allows weapon recall and enemy disarm.
    
    🌋 Lava (Volcanic Surge)
    Melts enemy weapons and terrain.
    
    Creates volcanic eruptions beneath enemies’ feet.
    
    Armor plates can become lava-tipped for extra burn.
    
    💨 Air (Skywalker Circuit)
    Hovering, aerial dodges, tornado kicks.
    
    Channels wind pressure into sharp cutting force.
    
    Controls surrounding air density to reduce or increase resistance.
    
    🌀 Gravity (Forcefield Pulse)
    Slams enemies with 10x gravity.
    
    Levitate boulders, vehicles, or entire enemy teams.
    
    Forms Graviton Shields or creates instant craters on impact.
    
    ⚡ Speed (Kinetic Flux System)
    Time appears to slow while in motion.
    
    Dash-attacks, teleport-like strikes, speed mirages.
    
    Power Punches charged by built-up kinetic energy.
    
    🌐 Special Techniques
    Overdrive Annihilation Mode – All systems overload for 10 seconds of pure elemental destruction. The blade becomes
    uncontrollable and glows white-hot. Used as a final move.
    
    Plasma Drift Kick – Uses speed and lava trails to melt terrain while kicking opponents at supersonic speed.
    
    Steam Cyclone Vortex – Combines fire, water, and air to create a massive pressure-cyclone that can deflect projectiles.
    
    Meteor Hammer Slam – Uses gravity + lava + metal to slam down with a hammer-like force, cracking the land itself.
    
    Thermo-Graviton Pulse – Sends a gravity shockwave laced with boiling water and plasma in all directions.
    
    🧠 Strategic Advantage
    Balanced across all fields: long-range, melee, aerial, defense, and speed.
    
    Automatically adapts to environments (ocean, volcanoes, sky, battlefield).
    
    Constant energy flow system — water cools, fire fuels, speed rotates, gravity balances.
